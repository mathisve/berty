# Infra testing tool CLI

## Generate config

###`infra generate -f conf.yaml`

This command generates the config in both HCL and YAML in a folder called `infra`. The flag `-f` points to your yaml configuration file.

## Deploy infrastructure
###`infra deploy`

Use this command to deploy the infrastructure generated by the `generate` command. This will only work if you have the [**Terraform CLI**](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed!

## Destroy infrastructure
###`infra destroy`

If something went wrong, or you just want to destroy all infrastructure generated by `deploy`, you can use this command to destroy it. This will only work if you have the [**Terraform CLI**](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed!


## List current instances

###`infra getIps`

This command will list all currently running (or pending instances). Great for debugging
```
[mathis@arch infra-testing-tool]$ infra getIps
running:
test-peers-ff89c059, peer, i-07058919fcfd3cb29, 3.120.251.177
